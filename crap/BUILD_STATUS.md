# Build Status Update

## Current Situation
- Bazel is STILL RUNNING the XLA_BUILD=true compilation (started ~2 hours ago)
- Process ID: 72410
- This is building XLA/EXLA from source with CUDA support

## Why This Takes So Long
- Building XLA from source compiles:
  - LLVM components
  - MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation)
  - XLA core
  - CUDA kernels
  - Protobuf definitions
  - gRPC components
- This is a MASSIVE C++ codebase

## What's Happening vs What We Want
- EXLA keeps downloading `xla_extension-0.8.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-cpu.tar.gz` (CPU only)
- We need it to use `xla_extension-0.8.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-cuda12.tar.gz` (GPU)
- XLA_BUILD=true forces compilation from source with CUDA support

## The Right Approach
1. Let the bazel build complete (DO NOT INTERRUPT!)
2. Once built, EXLA should use the CUDA-enabled version
3. Then we can run our GPU verification test
4. If it shows "cuda:0", proceed with benchmarks

## Prime Directive Reminder
- Must see "cuda:0" in tensor output
- Must use propagate_to_geodetic() for fair comparison
